Disable "hands off" optimized mode
Update Info

The "hands off" mode will be the default mode and allows the program to
optimize access by agressively caching data.  For rigs with an interface lock,
the interface lock should be enabled.  Even in this mode however, it should
periodically poll to update the state when possible.

This is the default because some rigs (ie: FT-736R) are write-only CAT.  It's
not actually possible to *read* anything.

When hands off is disabled, every piece of information must be read from the
rig between when the request is recieved and the response is sent.  This must
not be emulated.  A FT-736R must not support the "hands on" mode.

As a strict rule, no "get" function should perform any action that could
interfere with transmitting.  For example, if an interface only allows reading
the frequency/mode of the "current" VFO, attempting to get the freq/mode of
the other VFO must fail.  The code MUST NOT change the current VFO to read
the value.
